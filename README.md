# GET-A-JOB
GET A JOB is a short game that simulates the decisions you have to make while you are aspiring to be hired as a software developer in 2020

This game is all about making decisions, and the outcome of those decisions. To make it interesting I made sure that there were more bad endings than good ones. So you would inevitably need a strategy to get the best outcome and ultimately a job.
